## 🚴 London Bike Rides Analysis Project

This project explores a dataset of London bike rides, focusing on understanding patterns in ride durations, frequency, and peak usage times across various areas of the city. Using **Python** and **Tableau**, I performed a comprehensive analysis to extract meaningful insights, create visualizations, and present data-driven conclusions. This project showcases my ability to handle the full data analysis pipeline, from data cleaning and preprocessing to visualization and insights generation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data manipulation and cleaning using `pandas` and `numpy`
- **Tableau**: For interactive data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document the data cleaning and analysis process
- **SQL**: Database querying for data extraction

### 🔧 Skills and Tools Utilized

- **Python**: Leveraged Python libraries like **pandas** for data manipulation and **matplotlib/seaborn** for initial data visualizations.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Performed thorough data cleaning and transformation in **Jupyter Notebooks**, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and data standardization.
- **SQL**: Used **SQL** queries to filter and organize data for analysis.
- **Tableau**: Built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to visualize key metrics such as hourly ride patterns, popular routes, and seasonal trends, making it easier to identify patterns and anomalies.
- **Data Visualization**: Created compelling visual stories using **Tableau** and **Python** visualizations to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.
- **Version Control**: Maintained code and documentation using **Git** and **GitHub**, ensuring a clear version history and reproducibility.

### 📊 Project Highlights

- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard**: [Explore the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/LondonBikeRidesDashboard_17285879727540/Hour?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) for an intuitive presentation of bike ride patterns across different times of the day and regions in London.
- **Data Insights**: Identified key factors influencing ride duration and frequency, including peak riding hours and seasonal trends.
- **Cleaned & Processed Data**: Ensured high data quality through consistent cleaning and preprocessing steps, making the dataset ready for deep analysis.
